## 🧬 What Is the Dark and Darker Cheat Menu?

It’s a **modular cheat hub** that hooks directly into the game and gives you real-time control over multiple hacks. Instead of running one script, you get a clean in-game menu (or hotkey overlay) where you can:

* Switch ESP modes
* Toggle aimbot or soft aim
* Control speed multiplier
* Enable loot vacuum or auto loot
* Activate wallhack
* Modify FOV, sensitivity, aim zones
* Create cheat profiles for each class/playstyle

This is the **one menu to rule them all** 🧙‍♂️
